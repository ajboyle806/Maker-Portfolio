      "This big handsome boy is Magoo. He is 130lb Bully mix who has the best personality. He is about 14 months old and all he wants is to go on walks, pick up sticks and give love. Magoo was rescued from a local very over-crowded shelter. His size can be slightly intimidating at first but once you spend time with him, you realize he's just a big teddy bear. Magoo is dog friendly and could do well by himself or with another super friendly and playful female dog. He is extremely strong so he will only be adopted into a family with large breed experience. He is good with children but due to his size he needs to be adopted into a home with kids over the age of 12. Magoo could definitely benefit from some basic training classes for manners because sometimes he doesn't realize his size. If you are looking for a furry weighted blanket, then Magoo could be the dog for you!",

Our volunteer took him to the Small Paws Shelter, nobody claimed him so we took him into our group and he is in a home with his Foster Dad.\n Bagel is a happy go lucky fellow with a fun personality and he gets along great with other dogs. He doesn’t let the fact he has three legs slow him down at all. He loves to run full speed with quick turns chasing his Foster buddies at the house, he wrestles and jumps just like a normal dog. \nHe loves stuffed toys and likes to toss them in the air, enjoys playing tug-of-war and fetch and also loves to sunbathe! He’s very affectionate and extremely happy to greet you with his howling bark when you come home and hopping to hug you. He bonds very quickly and loves everyone he meets, children or adults\nAfter a long day of playing with his Foster buddies, he likes to find a quiet dark place to go to sleep, sometimes climbing under a blanket. While people in his Foster household are doing other activities, he prefers to stay away from the ruckus of the family and sleep, especially on his back. \nBagel would be best suited in a home with a yard and another playful dog, as he is very active. No apartment living for this guy! He is up-to-date on vaccines, neutered and microchipped.

      "This handsome boy is Buddy! Buddy is a 1.5-year-old, 90lb, goofy guy that is looking for his happily ever after and we're hoping that will be you!\nBuddy first came to the shelter as a stray. Shortly after his arrival, he became a part of the shelter family and was promoted to an office. (Kennel life did not agree with him and boy did he let us know. Haha!) He was super pumped about his new digs, especially since he got to have an office mate! Buddy's a pretty social guy and he LOVES to be with people.\nBuddy is the type of dog that will be your best friend for life, given the opportunity. He is full of love, affection, and energy! He loves his people, and he loves them hard!\nSome of Buddy's favorite things to do at the shelter include going for car rides and having lunch dates with his besties, taking nice long walks through the woods, playing outside in the yard, and his absolute favorite thing is getting snuggles at the end of the day. I mean, from a human perspective, is there anything better than a squishy dog to snuggle with?!\nIf you've read this far, you're probably thinking \"why hasn't this boy found a home yet?\" Well, Buddy, like the rest of us, has his flaws. Remember when I told you he loves people? He loves them so much that he quickly becomes overly enthusiastic when they visit him, but unfortunately, he cannot always contain his enthusiasm and becomes jumpy and when overstimulated, mouthy (there is no aggression behind any of these behaviors). He's been working really hard to control all that excitement with a couple of cuessit, stay, and relax, and to show his excitement in a more socially acceptable manner. The good news is all his hard work is starting to pay off!\nGoing outside is a very exciting thing for Buddy! When he gets outside and is nose to the ground smelling all that deliciousness, he can become distracted and will sometimes forgets he's attached to a leash with a person on the other end. So, we've been doing some leash training to help him learn he can still enjoy all those great things while his friends safely enjoy the walk with him. He thoroughly enjoys romping through the woods on a long lead, too. He does quite phenomenal walking like this.\nBuddy will do best with someone who has had experience with extra-large dogs and training dogs through their adolescent phase of life. \nBuddy's shelter friends absolutely love his playful, lovable demeanor. He is so incredibly affectionate and fills your heart with so much love! And not to mention, he can seriously entertain you for hours! He is just the best boy!\nAn older teen home or adult only home would be quite suitable for this gentle giant. He would do best as an only dog as he has been dog reactive at the shelter.",

      "This 8-10 year old senior schnauzer was an anxious matted mess brought to a local pound. He’s a friendly guy who craves attention and came right over for a hug and cuddle when we met him, desperate to get out of his kennel. After a shave down and dental cleaning he looks, feels, and smells like a new man and is ready to find a home that appreciates this smart loyal talkative breed. Nathaniel seems a bit overwhelmed by other dogs from what we can tell so far, and would probably prefer to be your only dog, or possibly with a calmer female. He doesn’t seem very used to walking on a leash at least for using the bathroom and “holds it” til let out into a fenced yard. His bloodwork was perfect and he didn’t need any teeth pulled during his dental, but does have some pretty bad and painful arthritis in his back so will be on some joint supplements and pain medication longterm, and will need to stay trim to avoid putting extra strain on his back. He might get cranky when painful and doesn’t like other dogs jumping on him (or probably young kids either) and is looking for a calmer adult home that understands the breed. He bonds very quickly and then follows you staring at you with his schnauzerly eyes of love and smirky little whisker face.",

      "This 8-10 year old senior schnauzer was an anxious matted mess brought to a local pound. He’s a friendly guy who craves attention and came right over for a hug and cuddle when we met him, desperate to get out of his kennel. After a shave down and dental cleaning he looks, feels, and smells like a new man and is ready to find a home that appreciates this smart loyal talkative breed. Nathaniel seems a bit overwhelmed by other dogs from what we can tell so far, and would probably prefer to be your only dog, or possibly with a calmer female. He doesn’t seem very used to walking on a leash at least for using the bathroom and “holds it” til let out into a fenced yard. His bloodwork was perfect and he didn’t need any teeth pulled during his dental, but does have some pretty bad and painful arthritis in his back so will be on some joint supplements and pain medication longterm, and will need to stay trim to avoid putting extra strain on his back. He might get cranky when painful and doesn’t like other dogs jumping on him (or probably young kids either) and is looking for a calmer adult home that understands the breed. He bonds very quickly and then follows you staring at you with his schnauzerly eyes of love and smirky little whisker face.",
